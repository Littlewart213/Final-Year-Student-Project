# Final-Year-Student-Project
Developing hybrid model VGG16 and SVM to classifity brain tumor into three classes encompass meningioma, glioma, and pituitary. This model works efficiently with and achived high accuracy at 95.7% with running time considerably fast which below 3 minutes. Also, the code visualizes the extracted features from MRI image to mapping the Features
