# Final-Year-Student-Project
Developing a hybrid model using VGG16 and SVM to classify brain tumors into three classes: meningioma, glioma, and pituitary. This model operates efficiently and achieves a high accuracy of 95.7%, with a considerably fast running time of under 3 minutes. Additionally, the code visualizes the extracted features from MRI images to map the features
